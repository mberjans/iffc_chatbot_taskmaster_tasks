### KAG Progress Report

## KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-DEFINE_KG_SCHEMA (Define KG Schema)

**Status**: Completed

**Implementation Details**:

- Defined a comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG) schema for the KAG module in `src/kag/schema/kg_schema.py`
- Implemented the following entity types relevant to scientific papers and biomedical concepts:
  - Paper: Scientific paper or article with properties like paper_id, title, abstract, doi, etc.
  - Author: Person who authored a paper with properties like name, affiliation, etc.
  - Section: Section within a paper with properties like section_id, title, content, etc.
  - Figure: Figure within a paper with properties like figure_id, caption, image_url, etc.
  - Table: Table within a paper with properties like table_id, caption, content, etc.
  - Citation: Citation within a paper with properties like citation_id, text, context, etc.
  - Concept: General concept mentioned in a paper with properties like concept_id, name, description, etc.
  - Method: Research method mentioned in a paper with properties like method_id, name, description, etc.
  - Result: Research result mentioned in a paper with properties like result_id, description, significance, etc.
  - Gene: Gene mentioned in a paper with properties like gene_id, symbol, name, etc.
  - Protein: Protein mentioned in a paper with properties like protein_id, name, function, etc.
  - Disease: Disease mentioned in a paper with properties like disease_id, name, description, etc.
  - Chemical: Chemical mentioned in a paper with properties like chemical_id, name, formula, etc.
- Implemented the following relation types connecting these entities:
  - AUTHORED_BY: Connects Paper to Author
  - CONTAINS_SECTION: Connects Paper to Section
  - CONTAINS_FIGURE: Connects Paper to Figure
  - CONTAINS_TABLE: Connects Paper to Table
  - CONTAINS_CITATION: Connects Paper to Citation
  - CITES: Connects Paper to Paper
  - MENTIONS: Connects Paper to Concept/Gene/Protein/Disease/Chemical
  - INTERACTS_WITH: Connects Gene/Protein to Gene/Protein
  - ASSOCIATES_WITH: Connects Disease to Gene/Protein
  - USED_IN: Connects Method to Paper/Section
  - RESULTS_IN: Connects Method to Result
  - SUPPORTS: Connects Result to Concept
  - CONTRADICTS: Connects Result to Concept
- Implemented validation functions for entities and relations to ensure data integrity according to the schema
- Created utility functions to retrieve entity and relation types and schemas
- Verified the implementation with a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering schema structure, validation logic, and error handling
- Updated the KAG module's `__init__.py` to properly expose the schema components

## KAG_DEV-NXS-1A-001-CHOOSE_KG_LIBRARY (Choose KG Library)

**Status**: Completed

**Implementation Details**:

- Selected NetworkX as the knowledge graph library for the KAG module based on project requirements and the phased development plan
- Implemented a comprehensive KG library module in `src/kag/library/kg_library.py` with the following components:
  - Defined the KG_LIBRARY configuration with metadata about the selected library (NetworkX), including version, description, selection rationale, limitations, and future alternatives
  - Implemented core knowledge graph functions:
    - `create_knowledge_graph()`: Creates a new empty knowledge graph using NetworkX's MultiDiGraph
    - `add_entity()`: Adds an entity to the graph with specified type and properties
    - `add_relation()`: Adds a relation between entities with specified type and properties
    - `get_entity()`: Retrieves an entity from the graph by ID
    - `get_relations()`: Retrieves relations from the graph with optional filtering by source, target, or relation type
    - `get_entities_by_type()`: Retrieves all entities of a specific type
  - Implemented serialization and persistence functions:
    - `serialize_graph()`: Serializes the graph to a string in various formats (GraphML, GEXF, JSON)
    - `deserialize_graph()`: Deserializes a string representation back into a graph
    - `save_graph()`: Saves the graph to a file
    - `load_graph()`: Loads a graph from a file
    - `get_library_info()`: Returns information about the selected library
- Created a comprehensive test suite in `tests/kag/library/test_kg_library.py` to verify the functionality of all KG library components
- Updated the KAG module's `__init__.py` to expose the library components
- Added NetworkX as a dependency in requirements.txt
